Problem statement – the Zomato dataset has information about app, review date, review description, rating, tums up count, developer response, developer response date, app version. In this dataset do text processing to review description and rating as dependent variable write codes for natural language processing and use random forest classifier by taking training size 70% and remaining data for testing and check the accuracy, prepare classification report.



Tools used – pandas, exploratory data analysis, sklearn, nltk, word cloud, random forest classifier.



Outcome –after text processing by using natural language processing the outcome of random forest classifier is 74%. And precision rate 0.764, recall rate 0.975, f1 score 0.857 is highest in first category 1.
